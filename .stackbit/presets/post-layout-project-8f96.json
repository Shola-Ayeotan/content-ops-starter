By analyzing applicant information like income and credit score, the model predicts loan eligibility, streamlining the approval process.\n\n#### Objective\n\nThe primary goal was to create an efficient and accurate model to predict whether an applicant is eligible for a loan based on their demographic and financial information. This approach reduces the manual effort involved in loan processing and enhances the consistency of approval decisions.\n\n#### Tech Stack\n\n*   Programming Language: Python\n\n*   Libraries: Scikit-learn, H2O, pandas, numpy, Flask, Seaborn, Matplotlib\n\n*   Containerization: Docker\n\n#### Dataset Description\n\nThe dataset used for this project is an anonymized, synthetic dataset designed to mirror real-world loan data. It contains over 100,000 records, each with detailed information about the customer's financial history and loan application.\n\n#### Approach:\n\n1.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\n\n*   Missing data analysis and imputation.\n\n*   Removal of irrelevant features.\n\n*   Visualization of feature distributions.\n\n2\\. Data Pre-processing:\n\n*   Handling of outliers.\n\n*   Categorical data encoding using One-Hot and Label Encoding.\n\n3\\. Feature Engineering:\n\n*   Creation of non-linear combinations of features.\n\n*   Addition of derived features based on existing data.\n\n*   Applied Standard Scaler to normalize the data.\n\n4\\. Modeling:\n\n*   Implemented various machine learning models including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.\n\n*   Models were evaluated using metrics like Precision, Recall, AUC, and F1 Score.\n\n5\\. Hyperparameter Tuning:\n\n*   Used GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.\n\n6\\. Model Deployment:\n\n*   Deployed the final model using Flask, encapsulated in a Docker container for easy scalability and deployment.\n\n#### Project Takeaways\n\n*   Mastered EDA techniques for complex datasets.\n\n*   Gained expertise in data cleaning, feature engineering, and data standardization.\n\n*   Developed multiple machine learning models and evaluated their performance.\n\n*   Successfully deployed a predictive model using Flask and Docker.\n\n*   Improved understanding of model metrics such as AUCPR, AUC, and F1 Score.\n\n#### Impact\n\nThe final model achieved a high accuracy rate, enabling quicker and more consistent loan approval decisions. This solution effectively reduces the risk of loan defaults and helps financial institutions optimize their loan portfolios.\n\n"
